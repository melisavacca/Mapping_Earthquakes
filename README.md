# Mapping_Earthquakes

This map is created to show different earthquakes with two different makes and an earthquake overlay.  In this challegne, we show one map with the earthquake data in relation to the tetonic plates' location on the earth and one map with all of the earthquakes that have a magnitude greater than 4.5.  We can show all of this on a satellite streets map, a streets map, and a light map.  See screenshots below of different versions of the map.
